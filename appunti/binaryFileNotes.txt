PROJECT: Regarding the dimension of the binary files...

We have made some calculation regarding the dimension of the binary files:
- Due to Nyquist theorem, the sampling frequency must be at least double the maximum signal dynamic = f0 + B + Df (f0 = carrier frequency = ~1.6GHz, B = unilateral bandwidth = ~1MHz, Df = doppler shift <100KHz (@TODO)) < 1.1 * f0 -> fSampling > 2.2 * f0 = 3.5GHz
- The number of the IQ samples in the binary file is nbit * M * Tp * fSampling (nbit = packet length = 80/120 bits, M = PRN repetitions per symbol < 10, Tp = PRN period = ~1ms) < 4.2e9
- The file dimension is nIQ * 2 * 8bit = ~8.4GB

If our calculation are correct, we think it is quite difficult to handle this file in any programming language and framework if we sample at double the carrier frequency.
We propose than the signal created by the transmitter is already downconverted at the intermediate frequency (as explained in Lecture 17) that must be greater that 2 * (B + Df). If the sampling frequency is approx. 60MHz (as reported in the slide 20 of the file GNSSReceiverArchitecture.pdf), the number of samples will be 72e6, and the file dimension ~144MB, that is still very large.
We think even if the sampling frequency is lowered to ~10MHz, the results will be accurate enough for the project.
We are looking forward to a response from the scenario manager.
